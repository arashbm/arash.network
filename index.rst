============================

Hi, I’m Arash Badie-Modiri. I’m a Doctor of Science in Technology (DSc. Tech.)
candidate at Aalto University. I study complex systems: systems composed of a
large number of components that interact with each other, such as neurons in a
human brain, people in a social network or buses in a public transport network.
These systems show complex behaviour that emerges only when many of these
components interact with each other.

Recently, I have been working on understanding systems that evolve through time
(temporal networks) and how an effect (such as a communicable disease or a meme)
spreads in a system.

Check out my published and pre-print papers on `Google Scholar`_ and on
`arXiv`_.

.. _arXiv: https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Arash+Badie-Modiri&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50


I have also been developing scientific software for network scientists like me.
`Reticula`_, empowers researchers to effieciently study properties of static
networks, hypergraphs and temporal networks using Python or C++.
